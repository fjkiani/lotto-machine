          "reportTitle": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.",

The index rose 2.1% on Friday, with the Nasdaq popping 2.6% and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) 2.5%. On the upside for the SPX, a 38.2% retracement of the decline is at 5,750; a 50% take-back comes in at 5,825; and the key 61.8% retracement lies at 5,900. Initial chart resistance comes in at 5,930, while the slowly declining 50-day average is at 5,940.  A short-term SPX buy signal was tripped on Wednesday. The VIX closed outside its upper daily Bollinger Band on Monday, fell inside the upper band on Tuesday, and closed lower Wednesday. This three-day sequence gave us a VIX sell signal and the S&P 500 buy signal. We also have seen numerous bullish breadth divergences, but long-term breadth remains a concern.   The SPX completed a double top on the weekly chart, which is not common, and a measured move based on the size of the pattern initially targets 5,500 and then 5,400. The index is below the 13-, 26-, and 40-week moving averages for the first time since October 2023 -- which can lead to much deeper downside moves. But to confirm longer-term damage, we need the 13-week to break both the 26- and 40-week and need the 26-week to cross below the 40-week average. The SPX also has (very quickly) broken below its lower weekly Bollinger Band for the first time since October 2023. That sets up the potential for a fairly reliable buy signal if the index can reclaim the lower band. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

Throughout the year, we will take a deep dive into these themes, providing updates and giving stock picks on the prominent companies whose businesses play out in each theme. In many cases, we believe these thematic factors will supersede industry characteristics and drive performance. Our Investment Themes for 2025 are: Theme 1: Management Signals; Theme 2: Artificial Intelligence; Theme 3: Clean Energy; Theme 4: Sustainable Impact investing; Theme 5: Innovation; Theme 6: Cybersecurity; Theme 7: Investing in the Cloud; Theme 8: Aerospace and Defense, All Systems Go; Theme 9: Uptick in Capex amid Declining Interest Rates; and Theme 10: Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology. For this week's Weekly List, we examine Theme 7: Investing in the Cloud. Cloud computing has transformed the technology landscape over the past decade. Created almost accidently as a means or organizing customer invoices, cloud has grown from the management of outsourced technology hardware resources to encompass tasks, up to and including software development, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, following availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, awareness of generative AI hit the business community like an electric shock, and has completely upended IT spending plans for the next several years. Given that delivery of AI will mainly occur within a hybrid cloud environment, emergence of AI-as-a-service represents a difficult-to-quantify, but undoubtedly positive driver of cloud service revenues in the coming years. The leading providers of cloud services tend to be large technology and communications services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their cloud businesses. These companies include Amazon.com, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others in the U.S., along with Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and others in China. Collectively, participants in the cloud eco-system grew revenue by a high-teens compound annual rate from 2016 to 2023. Revenue for cloud services has held up well, as cloud transition is a long-tailed process and cloud transformation has become an imperative. According to IDC, revenue in the industry grew 21% in 2024. Looking ahead, with inflation growth slowing and amid improving business and consumer confidence, both consumer device demand and enterprise IT spending should accelerate. We expect rising device demand and enterprise IT spending both domestically and internationally to drive cloud investment in 2025 and beyond. Some of the companies that should benefit in the space include the following.",

          "reportTitle": "With large gains in the stock market last week, the S&P 500 (SPX) broke its downtrend line off the peaks since mid-December. Intraday last Monday, the index tested the bottom of its bearish channel at 5,773 and bounced for the rest of the week. From Monday's low, the SPX finished with a 3.3% pop and the string of lower highs and lower lows has been busted. In addition, the five-day/13-day exponential moving average crossover (EMA) turned bullish after a December 18 sell signal.   For stocks, it's the good, the bad, and the undecided. The SPX traced out a doji candlestick during its big gain on Friday, a sign of indecision. The index did regain its 50-day average, but the daily vortex indicator and the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) remain on sell signals. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke its downtrend, a potentially bullish sign, while breadth showed a lot of improvement during the week.   The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has jumped 4.4% from its intraday low last Monday and is back over its 50-day. The QQQ moved above the bearish channel on Friday, but closed right at the upper trendline as the ETF traced out a bearish \"hanging man\" candlestick. These candlesticks can sometimes appear at the end of a bounce or advance.    The impetus for stocks was bonds after December's CPI. The 10-year yield finished the week at 4.61%, down from an intraday high of 4.81% on Tuesday. The five-year dropped 21 basis points (bps) from its high, to 4.4%, while the two-year fell 14 bps, to 4.29%. The stock and bond action this week could lay the groundwork for either all-time highs or continued weakness in equities. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

          "reportTitle": "As we said recently, equity investors don't seem to have a lot to worry about as we move toward 2025. Still, there is always something to worry about. As we see it, the big technical issues are the multiple weekly momentum divergences on the S&P 500 (SPX) and the futures positions of the smart money commercial hedgers in the major indices. As well, the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) are working on only their first weekly momentum divergence. And yes, market participants are pretty bulled up -- especially in the options market.    For the SPX, the Chande Trend Meter is a strong 88% and 70% of stocks in the index are above their 200-day average (bullish, yet down from 85% in September and October). As well, the index is at an all-time high; daily and weekly charts are approaching (but are not yet at) overbought momentum territory; the Bullish Percent Index (the percentage of stocks in the index on point-and-figure buy signals) is bullish at 71% (but lower than the 81% from September); the daily and weekly Vortex Indicator are bullish; the slope of the advance is not too steep (as calls for a possible year-end melt-up have not yet materialized); and the advance-decline line and advancing volume-declining volume line on the index are at or near all-time high territory.     So if all those technical indicators are positive, is there only one direction for them to go? Well, they can always get even more bullish -- but yes, the above is a legitimate question. Bull markets tend to last longer than many expect and often go further than the fundamental news sometimes suggests is reasonable. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced in January 2020 that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

Taking a look at 13F filings from well-known institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy adding new companies to their portfolios or expanding existing holdings. Buying occurred across a range of sectors. Vickers Stock Research, a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, analyzes insider trading and institutional stock ownership. Form 13-Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters and have come in for 3Q24. We review 13Fs of major institutional investors, including activists, to see what they are buying and to look for trends. Activist investing is now less about generating a short-term return and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnerships. Based on data from Vickers, the following is a list of select purchases made in the third quarter by some high-profile money managers, including the Argus Research investment ratings.",

The Nasdaq, Nasdaq100, and S&P 100 were all flat. The larger losses came from recent leaders, with the S&P MidCap 400 falling 1% and the S&P SmallCap 600 dipping 1.5%. Has a fear of large, round numbers on some of the major indices replaced a fear of missing out (FOMO)? Or can we just call it profit taking on a very short, but torrid, advance higher?   With the smaller and less-concentrated indices falling the most, the reading for market breadth was very bad. The reading for NYSE advances-decliners was -1,917; the reading for NYSE advancing issues/total issues was a weak 20% (one of the worst days in recent months); and the reading for NYSE advancing volume/total volume was 29%.   The S&P 500 sectors didn't inspire a lot of confidence, but it's only one day. Materials dropped 1.7%, Healthcare gave up 1.4%, Consumer Discretionary and Real Estate fell 1.3%, Utilities dipped 1.2%, and Industrials fell 0.9%. Communication Services led, with a 0.5% gain.     Bitcoin reached $90,243 intraday despite the continued rally in the U.S. Dollar Index. So much for the consistent negative correlation between the two assets. However, gold futures fell to $2,606/oz., the lowest mark since September and a clear trend break. Silver futures finished near $31/oz., after hitting $35/oz. late in October. The COT data for metals remains bearish and the COT data for the greenback remains bullish -- so additional weakness in metals is quite possible. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

          "reportTitle": "The back-to-school shopping season has just ended. In a blink, we'll be shopping for the holidays. That's should add up to a lot of shopping - but we'll see how secure consumers are feeling about their finances. Shopping patterns offer great insight into the state of consumers, who are the backbone of the U.S. economy (accounting for two-thirds of GDP). It's still a little early for some of the bigger industry groups to put out their holiday estimates, but we do have some data points to consider. Overall, the National Retail Federation expects retail sales to increase 2.5%-3.5% for the entire year. Stastista expects a 4% increase in holiday sales for 2024 compared to 2023. eMarketer forecasts a healthy 4.8% rise in holiday sales compared to last year. Salesforce predicts a 2% increase in 2024 holiday sales, which is still growing but at a slower pace than the 3% logged last year. In sum, consumer spending growth could be between 2%-5% this holiday period. Meanwhile, Forbes notes the following particulars about this upcoming holiday season: 1) it is shortened, with only 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas; 2) past presidential election years have shown a dip in spending leading up to and following the election; and 3) Walmart and Amazon account for roughly 38% of total retail growth, presenting a challenge for other retailers. The following is a list of BUY-rated stocks in Argus' Universe of Coverage. These represent companies that are leaders in the retail industry. Some of these stocks are also in various Argus portfolios.",

These weak labor numbers raise questions: Did the Fed wait too long before pivoting to easing monetary policy? Will they enact a larger cut in September, perhaps 50 bps instead of the expected 25 bps? Is the desired soft landing still possible?

The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the Nasdaq gave back almost 2%, the Nasdaq 100 declined 2.2%, and the S&P 100 dropped 1.6%. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 (IWM) surged 3.6%, the S&P MidCap 400 popped 2.5%, and the Invesco S&P 500 equal weight (RSP) gained 1.2%. NYSE breadth was quite strong at +2,200, NYSE advancing issues/total issues hit 78%, and NYSE advancing volume/total volume popped to 84%. Yes, you read that correctly. Talk about a day of rotation!   Real Estate (XLRE) was up 2.7% and Utilities surged 1.8%, both helped by falling interest rates. Materials rose 1.4%, Industrials rose 1.3%, Energy gained 1%, Financials rose another 0.8%, and Healthcare was up 0.7%. Information Technology dropped 2.5%, with semiconductors down 3%-4%.   As mentioned, momentum was scorching on Wednesday, with the S&P 500's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) hitting 82 on Wednesday, the most overbought reading since December 19, 2023. That was followed by a nasty one-day wonder to the downside and some chop for a couple of weeks before the index took off again. The 14-week RSI reached 77 this week, the highest since 79 was hit in late March -- just before a slide of several hundred points in the index that, of course, was followed by all-time highs.   The 14-day RSI for the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) hit 80 Wednesday after reaching 82 in mid-June. The 14-week RSI is in the mid-70s. Generally, we see some indigestion when we cycle this far into overbought territory. Then there is often another run higher. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

          "reportTitle": "The consistent strength of the S&P 500 (SPX) over the past two months has been impressive, especially after the strong advance from October 2023 until late-March 2024. The simple and trusty 5/13 exponential moving average (EMA) crossover has caught most of these moves and missed some of the downside in April. Daily momentum (14-day relative strength index) has cycled into an extreme overbought condition, but that same condition didn't stop the rally back in December. It is a warning to pay attention for divergences and/or price breakdowns, but not a reason to sell.  On the weekly chart, the SPX has run up to a longer-term trendline off the peaks since late 2022. Most trendlines are not perfect and don't hit every price point, so we certainly could draw the line a bit differently, trying to construct a regression line that best fits the peaks or troughs. We have a developing and bearish weekly moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD), this as the latest weekly closing high price has not been confirmed by a new momentum high and offers yet another warning.   The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has broken above the upper trendline drawn off the peaks since July 2023 and has demonstrated very strong momentum. We have seen periods of outperformance versus the \"500\" -- and even when the QQQ has taken a break, it has not really underperformed the SPX. However, the QQQ is quite extended versus the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. Buts these overbought conditions can last for many months and, again, are more a warning about an overheated market than a reason to sell. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced in January 2020 that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. At Argus Research, we track ESG developments at specific companies as part of our Management analysis - one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point Fundamental Approach. In addition to reviewing and measuring the ESG proclamations from the companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, the JUST Capital Foundation, and leverage its analysis and insights on the topic as well. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on these criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled focused lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We also have a Theme Model Portfolio based in part on the ESG criteria. To build the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio, we applied financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction, and growth at a reasonable price to our various lists. In addition, all stocks must be on the Argus BUY list. Here are the new stocks that have been added to the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio.",

The S&P MidCap 400 (MDY) gave back another 1.3%, and the Dow Industrials lost 1%. In the last seven days, the NYSE has dropped over 3%. In nine days, the SML is off 3.4% and the MDY is down 4%, while the DJIA has given back 4% over seven days. All four indices have broken through their 50-day averages for the first time since early/mid-April and all have given short-term sell signals by way of bearish five-day/13-day exponential moving average crossovers.   Sector damage has been broad from the recent highs, with Real Estate declining over 5%, Energy dropping 4.5%, Financials and Industrials off almost 4%, Healthcare down 3.4%, Staples and the high-flying Utilities losing 3%, and Materials and Discretionary dipping 2.8%. Only Technology and Communication Services are holding near their highs.   As we said late last week, market breadth has turned negative quickly after a strong period from mid-April to mid-May. NYSE breadth was a weak -2160, the second-worst reading in 2024, after a -1913 print on May 23. NYSE advancing/total issues was 21% and up volume/total volume was 16%, near the weak levels from May 23.

If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines and AI) and services (such as Zoom calls) and moving into new markets, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country.

After moving sideways until the beginning of 1981, the greenback spiked higher until early 1985, rising to $165 from $100. As quickly as it soared, it then came crashing down, tracing out a very narrow Christmas tree and ultimately bottoming in 1992 at $79. Since early 1986, the greenback has been trapped in a fairly wide range between $71, hit in 2008, and $120, reached in early 2002. Since a secondary low was hit in 2011, the USD has been in a fairly consistent but wide bullish channel. A major part of the USD is the euro (about 60%), so it's not surprising that since that currency began in 1999, it has been (very) negatively correlated with the greenback.",

Alphabet lost a steep 10% in one day last week after investors expressed their disappointment over growth in its cloud business. That same day, Microsoft surged after reporting better-than-expected growth in its Azure OpenAI cloud service. The race is on, and some will win and some will lose along the way. But the potential pie is big. In the internet era, in which digital commerce complements or has supplanted physical commerce, the information technology needs of all enterprises have grown. The traditional on-premises approach has been rendered inefficient, given that a user's IT needs may fluctuate at any time. Into this void, the Cloud has arrived. In Cloud services models, an enterprise's IT needs can be matched and scaled in real time. Through the Cloud, enterprises consume only as much computing, storage, and networking bandwidth as they need. For a major event, this allows massive scaling of IT resources beyond the restraints of on-premises implementation. For periods in which operations are steady, the Cloud services model allows for a needs-only application. The leading providers of Cloud services tend to be large Technology and Communication Services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their Cloud businesses. Growth has been impressive for this group. Collectively, participants in the Cloud eco-system grew revenue at a 19% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2022. Still, the line isn't straight up.  While Cloud services grew at a 23% growth rate from 2020 to 2021, the average growth rate slowed to 15.3% for 2022.  This slowdown in revenue growth reflected impediments to normal business activity from the supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising interest rates. Even so, demand for Cloud services has held up relatively well, given that Cloud transition is a long-tailed process and that Cloud transformation has become an imperative. Here is a list of U.S.-based companies followed by Argus and that we think are in position to take advantage of this secular trend.",

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where labor and materials costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic and the current period of high inflation, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines) and services (such as Zoom calls) and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country. The current high level of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies around the world attests to the confidence that global investors have in the durable and innovative U.S. economy.",

          "reportTitle": "The growth prospects for the artificial intelligence (AI) universe are impressive, yet hard to determine. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba). Finally, Niche Tech has significant AI activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation and connectivity solutions for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas. Here are featured companies followed by Argus in those three categories.",

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where labor and materials costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic and the current period of high inflation, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines) and services (such as Zoom calls) and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country. The current high level of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies around the world attests to the confidence that global investors have in the durable and innovative U.S. economy.",
