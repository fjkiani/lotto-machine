2025-03-07 22:33:48,SPY,5. Nuanced Trading Recommendations:
2025-03-07 22:33:48,SPY,"Actionable Point:  Instead of simple buy/hold/sell recommendations, provide a range of options with clearly defined entry and exit points, stoploss orders, and riskreward ratios.  Consider incorporating more sophisticated trading strategies (options strategies, quantitative approaches) when appropriate.  Clearly state assumptions and limitations of the recommendations."
