2025-04-08 18:21:12,SPY,Actionable Point:  Develop a framework for evaluating the riskreward ratio for each recommended trade.  Clearly articulate the potential profit and loss scenarios and the associated probabilities.  The initial analysis should include a clear articulation of the riskreward ratio.
