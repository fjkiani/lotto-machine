How does the AI marketplace stack up against those metrics? Pretty well. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of major publicly traded players and most mid-tier players, along with our industry knowledge of private players. We estimate that global AI industry annual revenue amounted to $250 billion in 2024, and expect that to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when total revenue is forecast to reach $1.8 trillion. The emergence of China's DeepSeek, which caused a broad selloff in AI stocks, is a reminder that this space is dynamic and unpredictable. DeepSeek is reportedly inexpensive and powerful in achieving certain AI tasks. While pricing is important, companies in the AI space prioritize relationships, continuity, security, and reliability. The top priority for companies using AI delivered as-a-service across cloud is to ensure that delivery is secure, fast, and reliable -- and adding new vendors entails risk. U.S. government policy is highly likely to prevent wide dissemination of Chinese AI models in enterprise technology implementations in the U.S., given risks of \"back doors\" to Chinese military and intelligence. Non-U.S. nations are largely following similar policies, which should inhibit acceptance of Chinese AI models worldwide. Finally, AI hardware leaders such as Nvidia and AMD also offer GPU software libraries, model training, and inference services tailored to specific enterprise AI applications. The AI market is large and growing, and new entrants are expected to continue to disrupt the market.",

This \"barbell\" sector contains high-growth, low-income social media stocks on one end and low-growth, high-income telecom services stocks on the other. Hybrid cloud is emerging as the key delivery mechanism for AI-as-a-service. Social media stocks offering hybrid cloud services are positioned to benefit from the AI wave, in our view. As well, telecom stocks are likely near the end of mobile device weakness and are positioned for improved customer ARPU as the next generation of 5G smartphones launch in fall 2023. We have lowered Materials to Market-Weight from Over-Weight. Even as energy prices recover, many commodity prices have remained weak or weakened further. Most are traded in U.S. dollars. The dollar is inversely correlated to commodities, and long-term dollar strength is weighing on commodity prices. Elsewhere, demand from China remains sluggish as the lifting of zero-tolerance COVID restrictions has failed to stimulate the economy. Our current Over-Weight sectors are Communication Services, Financial Services, Consumer Discretionary and Technology. Our current Market-Weight sectors are Basic Materials, Industrials, Healthcare, Real Estate, and Utilities. Our Under-Weight sectors are Energy and Consumer Staples. We suggest that advisors and investors leverage this consistent and comprehensive process to adjust sector weightings within diversified equity portfolios, with a primary focus on the largest sectors.",

Turning to other data points, the unemployment rate was steady at 3.6%, and the number of unemployed persons was 6.0 million, up from 5.9 million in the prior month as workers reenter the workforce. Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents month-to-month and are now 5.2% higher year-over-year, compared to 5.5% last month. Revisions to the jobs totals in the two prior months subtracted 22,000 jobs from the economy. In May, jobs gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and transportation and warehousing. Employment in retail trade declined. The report indicates that the consumer segment of the economy is likely to remain on a growth track, despite the impact of the Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and higher prices at the gas pump.",

Average hourly earnings increased $0.08 month-to-month and are 4.8% higher year-over-year. Revisions to the two prior months added another 82,000 jobs to the economy. In November, job gains occurred in professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, construction, and manufacturing. Retail was lower. The report was a surprise to Wall Street, which was anticipating the economy would be building on the previous months' gains as the impact of the Delta variant faded. Now, in coming months, jobs growth may be suppressed by rising COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant. Stock futures are modestly higher on the news and bond yields have ticked lower.",
