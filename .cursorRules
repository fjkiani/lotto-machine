# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification
The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot
screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM
response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Streamlit App Review and Refactoring Plan

**Overall Goal:** To improve the modularity, testability, maintainability, and LLM utilization of the `streamlit_app_llm.py` application by refactoring the different analysis types and potentially implementing a more agentic workflow.

**Phase 1: Deep Dive & Code Review (Understand the Current State)**

*   **1.1. Review `EnhancedAnalysisPipeline` & Dependencies:**
    *   [✅] Read `src/analysis/enhanced_analysis_pipeline.py`.
    *   [✅] Understand its internal logic (Initial LLM -> Deep Reasoning LLM -> Feedback Module), LLM calls (`analyze_market_quotes_with_gemini`, `deep_reasoning_analysis`), and the feedback loop implementation (`implement_feedback_loop`).
    *   [✅] Reviewed `analyze_market_quotes_with_gemini` (in `src/llm/models.py`): Initial analysis based *only* on quote data. Prompt depends on `analysis_type`. Limited by input data scope.
    *   [✅] Reviewed `deep_reasoning_analysis` (in `deep_reasoning_fix.py`): Second LLM pass critiquing initial analysis based on quote data + initial analysis. Returns raw text. Hardcoded model.
    *   [✅] Reviewed `implement_feedback_loop` (in `src/analysis/feedback_loop.py`): Uses two more LLM calls to detect contradictions and generate learning points. Updates initial analysis based on keyword matching in LLM resolution text. Hardcoded model. Parsing reliant on LLM format adherence.
    *   [ ] Document how "Enhanced Analysis" differs from "Basic Analysis".
*   **1.2. Review `MemoryEnhancedAnalysis`:**
    *   [✅] Read `src/llm/memory_enhanced_analysis.py`.
    *   [✅] Understand how memory (`AnalysisMemory`) and technical history (`TechnicalIndicatorsStorage`) are integrated to provide context (`memory_context`, `technical_context`).
    *   [✅] Document the LLM calls (`_perform_analysis_with_memory` using hardcoded `gemini-1.5-flash`) and logic used (fetch quote -> update/verify technicals -> generate context -> analyze -> store result).
*   **1.3. Review Specific LLM Functions:**
    *   [✅] Analyze `analyze_with_gemini` (in `streamlit_app_llm.py`): Options analysis using `gemini-1.5-flash`. Detailed prompt requesting structured JSON output (sentiment, volatility, insights, single trade recommendation). Relies on `prepare_gemini_input` for data. Hardcoded model. JSON parsing has basic fallback.
    *   [✅] Analyze `analyze_technicals_with_llm` (in `streamlit_app_llm.py`): Technical analysis using `gemini-1.5-flash`. Calculates indicators, fetches history via `yfinance`. Incorporates simple historical feedback. Requests detailed JSON output. Hardcoded model. Feedback logic is basic.
    *   [✅] Analyze `generate_price_targets` (in `streamlit_app_llm.py`): Hybrid approach. Tries specialized LLM (`analyze_price_targets_with_llm`) first. Falls back to combining technicals, time series S/R, options implied moves, and volatility using weighted averages. Redundant data fetching. Hardcoded models/confidence.
*   **1.4. Review Data Fetching & Preparation:**
    *   [✅] Analyze `fetch_market_data`: Confirmed it uses direct API call, bypassing connector. **Needs refactoring.**
    *   [✅] Analyze `prepare_gemini_input`: Understands its purpose (formatting options data for LLM), necessity tied to `analyze_with_gemini`.
*   **1.5. Review Display Functions:**
    *   [✅] Analyze `display_market_overview`: Consumes data from direct API call via `fetch_market_data`. **Fragile.**
    *   [✅] Analyze `display_llm_options_analysis`: Consumes output from `analyze_with_gemini`. Coupled to LLM JSON format.
    *   [✅] Analyze `display_enhanced_analysis`, `display_memory_enhanced_analysis`, `display_technical_analysis`, `display_price_targets`: Understand their data consumption patterns.
*   **1.6. Identify Redundancy & Hardcoding:**
    *   [✅] Documented instances of repeated LLM interaction logic, display patterns, indicator calculations.
    *   [✅] Pinpointed hardcoded API calls, LLM model names/params, JSON structure dependencies, processing limits, timeframe mappings, display styles.

**Phase 2: Refactoring Strategy & Design**

*   **2.1. Define Modular Structure:**
    *   [✅] Propose creating separate Python modules for each analysis type (e.g., `src/analysis/general_analyzer.py`, `src/analysis/options_analyzer.py`, etc.). Each module would encapsulate the logic for its specific analysis type.
    *   [✅] Plan to move relevant functions (like `analyze_with_gemini`, `analyze_technicals_with_llm`) into their respective modules.
*   **2.2. Centralize Common Components:**
    *   [✅] Plan refactoring of data fetching (`fetch_market_data` removal, **mandatory use of connector**) into a shared data module or utility. Centralize indicator calculations.
    *   [✅] Plan creating a shared LLM interaction layer/wrapper (e.g., `src/llm/llm_client.py`) to standardize calls, handle errors, and parse JSON.
    *   [✅] Plan centralizing display logic using helper functions or dedicated display modules (e.g., `src/streamlit_app/ui_components.py`).
*   **2.3. Define Interfaces:**
    *   [✅] Define a standard input/output interface for each analysis module (accepting `ticker`, `connector`, `llm_client`, etc., returning structured dict).
    *   [✅] Define clear methods for the `llm_client` (e.g., `generate_json`).
    *   [✅] Display functions will expect these standardized dictionaries.
*   **2.4. Agentic Workflow Design (Based on User Clarification):**
    *   [✅] Aim for collaborative multi-agent system (technical, options, sentiment, risk agents + manager/synthesis agent).
    *   [ ] Design interaction flow and data protocols (Deferred - modularization is prerequisite).

**Phase 3: Implementation (Iterative)**

*   **3.1. Refactor Data Fetching (Immediate Priority):**
    *   [✅] Modify `streamlit_app_llm.py` to instantiate `YahooFinanceConnector` once.
    *   [✅] Replace the `fetch_market_data` function with calls to `connector.get_market_quotes(ticker)`.
    *   [✅] Update `display_market_overview` to correctly parse the `MarketQuote` object returned by the connector. (Fix applied for `isinstance` issue).
    *   [✅] Ensure `prepare_gemini_input` uses `connector.get_option_chain(ticker)` instead of the old `fetch_market_data` output.
*   **3.2. Create Core Modules:**
    *   [✅] Set up the new directory structure and empty Python files for each analysis type module and shared components (data, llm, display).
*   **3.3. Refactor Analysis Type 1 (Options Analysis):**
    *   [✅] Move `analyze_with_gemini` and `prepare_gemini_input` logic into `src/analysis/options_analyzer.py`.
    *   [✅] Update `streamlit_app_llm.py` to import and call `run_options_analysis` from the new module.
    *   [✅] Ensure data fetching uses the centralized component (done in 3.1).
    *   [ ] Add basic tests for the `OptionsAnalyzer` module (deferred).
*   **3.4. Refactor Analysis Type 2 (General Analysis):**
    *   [ ] Design the scope of "General Analysis" (360 view) - (Deferred).
    *   [ ] Migrate relevant logic (potentially from "Basic" or elements of "Enhanced") into `src/analysis/general_analyzer.py` (Deferred).
    *   [ ] Determine how agent outputs will contribute to this view.
*   **3.5. Refactor Remaining Analysis Types:**
    *   [✅] Refactor Technical Analysis (move `analyze_technicals_with_llm` to `src/analysis/technical_analyzer.py`, use connector, update main app). Fixed `calculate_indicators` call signature issue. Fixed historical data fetching logic (`use_rapidapi=False`).
    *   [✅] **Refactor Enhanced Analysis:**
        *   [✅] **Action:** Move `EnhancedAnalysisPipeline` class and related logic to `src/analysis/enhanced_analyzer.py`.
        *   [✅] **Action:** Create wrapper function `run_enhanced_analysis` in `src/analysis/enhanced_analyzer.py`.
        *   [✅] **Action:** Adjust imports in the new module (handle potential import errors for dependencies like `deep_reasoning`).
        *   [✅] **Action:** Delete old file `src/analysis/enhanced_analysis_pipeline.py`.
        *   [✅] **Action:** Remove old import and update `streamlit_app_llm.py` to import and call `run_enhanced_analysis`.
        *   [✅] **Verification:** Read `src/analysis/enhanced_analyzer.py`. Checked `streamlit_app_llm.py` imports and call site.
    *   [✅] **Refactor Memory-Enhanced Analysis:**
        *   [✅] **Action:** Create `src/analysis/memory_analyzer.py`.
        *   [✅] **Action:** Implement wrapper `run_memory_analysis` using `MemoryEnhancedAnalysis` instance and connector.
        *   [✅] **Action:** Update `streamlit_app_llm.py` to import and call `run_memory_analysis`.
        *   [✅] **Verification:** Checked import and call site in `streamlit_app_llm.py`.
*   **3.6. Refactor Main App:**
    *   [ ] Slim down `streamlit_app_llm.py` to primarily handle UI, input gathering, routing calls to the appropriate analysis modules, and calling display functions.
    *   [✅] **Action:** Move display functions (`display_market_overview`, `display_llm_options_analysis`, `display_enhanced_analysis`, `display_memory_enhanced_analysis`, `create_technical_chart`, `display_technical_analysis`, `display_price_targets`) to `src/streamlit_app/ui_components.py`. (Fix applied for `display_market_overview` `isinstance` and `create_technical_chart` `NameError`).
    *   [✅] **Action:** Update imports in both `streamlit_app_llm.py` and `src/streamlit_app/ui_components.py`.
    *   [✅] **Action:** Update call sites in `streamlit_app_llm.py`'s `main` function to use the display functions from the new module.

**Phase 4: LLM & Workflow Enhancement**

*   **4.1. Optimize LLM Prompts:**
    *   [ ] Review and refine prompts in all LLM-calling functions and modules for clarity, efficiency, and better instruction following.
    *   [ ] Ensure consistent JSON output formatting instructions.
*   **4.2. Enhance LLM Error Handling:**
    *   [ ] Implement robust error handling and fallback logic within the centralized LLM wrapper for API errors or parsing failures.
*   **4.3. Implement Agentic Workflow (If designed in Phase 2):**
    *   [ ] Build out the communication and orchestration logic for the multi-agent system.

**Phase 5: Testing & Validation**

*   **5.1. Unit & Integration Testing:**
    *   [ ] Write more comprehensive tests for each analysis module and shared component.
    *   [ ] Test the interactions between modules in the main Streamlit app.
*   **5.2. Functional Testing:**
    *   [ ] Manually run through each analysis type in the Streamlit app for various tickers to ensure correctness and expected behavior.
    *   [ ] Compare outputs before and after refactoring to check for regressions.
