  "macro_narrative": "On November 20, 2025, SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) closed nearly flat with a price change of approximately +0.19%, closing at $685.69. The exact open, high, and low prices were not fully detailed in the search results, but one source indicated prices around $672.91 to $675.56 on that day without conflict to the close price listed in the query, suggesting some discrepancies in reported data. The main causes of the relatively flat price action appear related to a balance of bullish momentum and some profit-taking after a prior buy signal from a pivot bottom point earlier that week, indicating a short-term rally that started around November 20 and rose about 4.88% in subsequent days[1]. Market participants were also watching earnings trades strategies and inflation data, which can contribute to cautious trading behavior around that period[5][6].\n\nThere was no reported dark pool share or max pain data available for that date, indicated explicitly as None%, which means these metrics were either not recorded or not disclosed publicly on November 20, 2025.\n\n**Summary of SPY price action on 2025-11-20:**\n\n| Metric    | Value           |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| Open      | Approx. $672.91 (source discrepancy noted) |\n| High      | Approx. $675.56 (same source)                |\n| Low       | Not precisely specified                     |\n| Close     | $685.69 (flat +0.19%) as per query          |\n| % Change  | +0.19% (flat close)                         |\n| Dark Pool Share | None%                                |\n| Max Pain  | None                                      |\n\nMain causes influencing this price action were a technical buy signal around this time that suggested a rally underway with subsequent strong price rises indicated post this date and mixed market inputs from inflation data and earnings-related positioning likely causing some hesitation resulting in a flat close[1][5][6].",
