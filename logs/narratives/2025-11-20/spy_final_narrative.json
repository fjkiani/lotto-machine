  "macro_narrative": "Based on the provided search results, here is a summary of the main causes for the SPY market move on November 20, 2025, and the status of dark pool and max pain data:\n\n### SPY Market Move (November 20, 2025)\n\n*   **Direction:** The SPY ETF declined on Thursday, November 20, 2025. The reported drop was **-1.52%** (TipRanks) to **-1.53%** (StockInvest.us), closing around **$652.56**.\n*   **Main Causes:** The primary driver for the decline was **volatility linked to Nvidia's (NVDA) post-earnings performance**. Nvidia is a major holding in the SPY ETF, and its results significantly impacted the broader market.\n*   **Other Contributing Factors:** The market also saw a broad advance in small-cap stocks (IWM) and the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ), but the S&P 500 (represented by SPY) was weighed down by the tech sector's volatility. The Fear & Greed Index improved slightly but remained in \"Extreme Fear\" territory.\n\n### Dark Pool and Max Pain Data\n\n*   **Dark Pool:** None of the provided results mention any specific dark pool activity or percentage for SPY on November 20, 2025. The query result states \"dark pool None%,\" indicating that this information is not available in the sources reviewed.\n*   **Max Pain:** None of the provided results mention the max pain price for SPY options on November 20, 2025. The query result states \"max pain None,\" indicating that this information is not available in the sources reviewed.\n\nIn summary, the SPY ETF's decline on November 20, 2025, was mainly due to volatility following Nvidia's earnings, but there is no available data in the provided results regarding dark pool activity or max pain for that date.",
  "sector_narrative": "On **November 20, 2025**, Invesco QQQ (QQQ) exhibited notable volatility with an intraday price range between approximately **$582.80 and $614.02** and closed around **$596.57 to $608.08** depending on the exact time within the day cited by different sources[3][5]. The QQQ stock dropped about **2.4% intraday**, reflecting significant selling pressure with volume rising 139% above average, indicating heavy trading activity and investor nervousness[3]. Despite this, QQQ showed resilience relative to its 52-week range ($402.39 to $637.01)[5].\n\nThe **tech sector narrative** around this date was characterized by a mixture of optimism and caution. While technology stocks, especially growth names like NVIDIA and Apple, continued to be key market drivers, there was pronounced volatility and intraday reversals in the market reflecting investor uncertainty[2][6]. Positive corporate earnings, including strong results from Nvidia, kept buyer interest alive, fueling bullish sentiment on technology and AI-related sectors[2][7][8]. Goldman Sachs maintained an overweight stance on U.S. tech, citing ongoing AI capital expenditure cycles as drivers for future growth, though they also highlighted elevated risk from high valuations and shifting macroeconomic sensitivities[6].\n\nAt the same time, concerns about potential overvaluation and bubble fears persisted, especially regarding whether AI investments would yield sufficient returns in the next few years. Market strategists pointed to a \u201ccoordinated risk off trade\u201d affecting tech stocks and cryptocurrencies due to valuation worries, Fed monetary policy uncertainty, and heightened volatility[4]. Investor sentiment was cautiously optimistic but wary of potential corrections if macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsened[2][4]. The strong labor market and robust consumer spending underpinned a generally positive fundamental environment, but the tech sector remained sensitive to shifts in interest rate expectations and economic growth[2].\n\nIn summary, on November 20, 2025, QQQ experienced a significant intraday sell-off amid elevated trading volumes, reflecting mixed investor sentiment as strong earnings and AI optimism competed against valuation and macro risks in the tech sector narrative[2][3][4][6].",

  "cross_asset_narrative": "On November 20, 2025, **Bitcoin experienced a notable decline**, falling by about 4.2% to roughly $86,677 after struggling around the $88K level amid a bearish trend, reflecting seller fatigue and investor jitters[4][5][3]. In contrast, **US equities exhibited mixed but generally mild positive movements** on the same day, with indexes such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones showing small gains or modest rises ranging from approximately +0.1% to +0.6%[3][6].\n\nThis indicates that **Bitcoin\u2019s price action on November 20, 2025, was weak and decoupled negatively relative to US equities**, which mostly held firm or advanced slightly. While Bitcoin declined sharply, US equities displayed modest resilience or minor gains amid market volatility.\n\nContextually, Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with US equities has been **variable over recent years**, sometimes strongly positive (correlation over 70%) especially during macroeconomic stress, and other times weak or negative during Bitcoin-specific rallies[2]. The current divergence on this date suggests **Bitcoin was behaving more like a risk asset influenced by crypto-specific bearish pressures**, distinct from the relatively stable equity markets.\n\nAdditional market context includes:\n\n- Cryptocurrency markets showing choppy, consolidating behavior with Bitcoin dominance holding steady around 59.3%[3].\n\n- Tech stocks and speculative assets including Bitcoin experiencing pressure, contributing to volatility in both crypto and equity markets, but equities not collapsing alongside Bitcoin[4].\n\n- Macro factors affecting both asset classes include hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric and geopolitical tensions impacting investor sentiment broadly, but with different intensity onsite[7][8].\n\nIn summary, on November 20, 2025, Bitcoin declined sharply due to specific bearish trends and investor selling, while US equities were mostly stable or slightly up, reflecting a partial decoupling of Bitcoin price action from traditional US stock market movements on that day[3][4][5].",
