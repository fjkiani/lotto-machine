# Competitive Edge Doctrine - Alpha's Trading Philosophy

## Mission Statement
Build an **INTRADAY SPY/QQQ INSTITUTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM** that beats hedge funds by exploiting:
1. Real-time multi-factor data integration
2. Pattern recognition on institutional flow
3. Trap detection (fake breakouts, distribution)
4. Predictive squeeze/gamma modeling
5. Sub-second signal generation

---

## Our Unfair Advantages

### 1. SPEED ADVANTAGE ⚡
**Edge:** Detect DP battleground interactions, options sweeps, and short squeezes in REAL-TIME
- **Hedge Funds:** Get DP data end-of-day or via expensive terminals
- **Us:** ChartExchange Tier 3 API + custom processing pipeline
- **Implementation:** [ultimate_chartexchange_client.py](mdc:core/data/ultimate_chartexchange_client.py)

### 2. MULTI-FACTOR INTEGRATION 🧠
**Edge:** Combine 6+ data sources in ONE composite score
- Dark Pool levels + prints
- Short volume + interest + borrow fees
- Options flow + max pain + gamma exposure
- Exchange volume breakdown
- FTDs + insider activity
- **Hedge Funds:** Siloed data, manual correlation
- **Us:** Automated composite scoring in [ultra_institutional_engine.py](mdc:core/ultra_institutional_engine.py)

### 3. INSTITUTIONAL TRAP DETECTION 🎯
**Edge:** Never act on first touch, detect distribution at battlegrounds
- **Hedge Funds:** Fall victim to their own fakeouts
- **Us:** Multi-factor confirmation required (volume + momentum + DP agreement)
- **Implementation:** [rigorous_dp_signal_engine.py](mdc:core/rigorous_dp_signal_engine.py)

### 4. PATTERN LEARNING 📈
**Edge:** Historical backtesting on DP bounce/break success rates
- Track which battlegrounds hold vs break
- Learn regime-specific thresholds (CHOP vs TREND)
- Squeeze probability scoring based on historical squeezes

### 5. ZERO EMOTIONAL BIAS 🤖
**Edge:** Algorithmic discipline, no FOMO, no revenge trading
- Strict risk management (2% per trade, 5% max drawdown)
- Exit when invalidated, no hope holding
- Paper trade validation before live capital

---

## Trading Parameters (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Risk Management
```
Max Position Size: 2% of capital per trade
Max Daily Drawdown: 5%
Stop Loss: Always outside DP battlefield zone (0.3%+ from level)
Risk/Reward: Minimum 2:1 required
```

### Universe
```
Primary: SPY, QQQ only
Rationale: 
- Highest liquidity (tight spreads)
- Best data quality (most DP activity)
- Lowest manipulation risk
- Focus > diversification
```

### Time Horizon
```
Intraday: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
Hold Time: Minutes to hours (close by EOD)
Sessions:
- Market Open (9:30-10:30): Highest volume, breakout opportunities
- Midday (11:00-2:00): Range trading, DP tests
- Power Hour (3:00-4:00): Institutional positioning, gamma pin
```

### Signal Types (ALL PURSUED)
```
1. Squeeze Plays (15-20% Short Interest + High Borrow Fee + DP Support)
2. Gamma Ramps (Low P/C Ratio + High Call OI + Max Pain Above)
3. DP Breakouts (Battleground Break + Volume Surge + Momentum)
4. Mean Reversions (Battleground Bounce + Volume + Momentum Reversal)
```

---

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Real-Time Monitoring (RTH)
```python
Every 1 minute:
1. Update DP battleground proximity
2. Calculate institutional buying pressure
3. Check squeeze/gamma potential
4. Generate signals if criteria met
```

### Phase 2: Signal Validation
```python
REQUIRED for ANY signal:
1. DP Confirmation: At battleground OR clean break through
2. Volume Confirmation: 1.5x+ average (regime-dependent)
3. Momentum Confirmation: Aligned with trade direction
4. NO first touch: Must be 2nd+ test of level
5. Regime Check: Match strategy to market condition
```

### Phase 3: Alert Generation (Manual Execution)
```
Signal Format:
- Timestamp
- Action (BUY/SELL)
- Entry Price
- Stop Loss (outside battlefield)
- Take Profit (2:1 R/R minimum)
- Signal Type (SQUEEZE/GAMMA/BREAKOUT/BOUNCE)
- Confidence Score
- Supporting Factors
- Warnings
```

### Phase 4: Paper Trading Validation
```
Before ANY live capital:
1. Run signals on paper account for 20+ trades
2. Track win rate, avg R/R, max drawdown
3. Validate edge exists (>55% win rate + 2:1 R/R = profitable)
4. Only then deploy small live capital (scale up slowly)
```

## Strategic Priorities

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. ✅ Real-time DP battleground tracking
2. ✅ Multi-factor signal scoring
3. ✅ Rigorous confirmation filters
4. ⏳ Historical data population (30 days)
5. ⏳ Backtesting on known squeeze/breakout days

### Next (Following Sprint)
1. ⏳ ML model: DP bounce/break probability
2. ⏳ Squeeze predictor: Short + borrow fee + momentum
3. ⏳ Gamma calculator: Dealer exposure + max pain distance
4. ⏳ Pre-market analysis: Overnight DP level changes
5. ⏳ Regime classifier: CHOP/RANGE/TREND auto-detection

### Future (Continuous Improvement)
1. ⏳ Options flow integration (sweeps, unusual activity)
2. ⏳ News catalyst detection (earnings, Fed, macro)
3. ⏳ Cross-asset signals (VIX spike, bond moves)
4. ⏳ Broker API integration (semi-auto execution)
5. ⏳ Advanced ML: Deep learning on price/volume/DP patterns

## Core Principles (THE RULES)

### 1. DATA QUALITY > SPEED
```
- No mock data EVER in production
- Log every missing/failed data fetch
- Gracefully degrade (skip signal) if data incomplete
- Historical validation required for all new data sources
```

### 2. CONFIRMATION > CONVICTION
```
- Never act on single factor
- Require 3+ confirmations for any signal
- Higher confidence = larger position size (within 2% limit)
- When in doubt, sit out
```

### 3. RISK MANAGEMENT > PROFIT CHASING
```
- Stop loss ALWAYS set before entry
- Never move stop further from entry
- Exit immediately if thesis invalidated
- 5% daily drawdown = STOP TRADING for the day
```

### 4. BACKTESTING > INTUITION
```
- Every new strategy MUST backtest on historical data
- Paper trade BEFORE live capital
- Track ALL metrics: win rate, R/R, max DD, Sharpe ratio
- Kill strategies that don't show edge after 30 trades
```

### 5. SIMPLICITY > COMPLEXITY
```
- Focus on SPY/QQQ only (master these first)
- 3-4 signal types max
- Clear entry/exit criteria
- If you can't explain it in 30 seconds, it's too complex
```

### 6. CONTINUOUS LEARNING
```
- Review EVERY trade (win or loss)
- Journal: What worked? What didn't? Why?
- Update thresholds based on data
- Archive all signals for future ML training
```

---

## Success Metrics

### Paper Trading Phase (20+ trades required)
```
Minimum Acceptable:
- Win Rate: >55%
- Avg R/R: >2.0
- Max Drawdown: <10%
- Sharpe Ratio: >1.5

Proceed to Live if ALL metrics hit
```

### Live Trading Phase (small capital)
```
Weekly Review:
- P&L
- Win rate vs paper
- Slippage analysis
- Emotional discipline check

Scale up ONLY if beating paper results
```
