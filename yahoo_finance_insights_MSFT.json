          "reportTitle": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.",

Created almost accidently as a means or organizing customer invoices, cloud has grown from the management of outsourced technology hardware resources to encompass tasks, up to and including software development, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, following availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, awareness of generative AI hit the business community like an electric shock, and has completely upended IT spending plans for the next several years. Given that delivery of AI will mainly occur within a hybrid cloud environment, emergence of AI-as-a-service represents a difficult-to-quantify, but undoubtedly positive driver of cloud service revenues in the coming years. The leading providers of cloud services tend to be large technology and communications services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their cloud businesses. These companies include Amazon.com, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others in the U.S., along with Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and others in China. Collectively, participants in the cloud eco-system grew revenue by a high-teens compound annual rate from 2016 to 2023. Revenue for cloud services has held up well, as cloud transition is a long-tailed process and cloud transformation has become an imperative. According to IDC, revenue in the industry grew 21% in 2024. Looking ahead, with inflation growth slowing and amid improving business and consumer confidence, both consumer device demand and enterprise IT spending should accelerate. We expect rising device demand and enterprise IT spending both domestically and internationally to drive cloud investment in 2025 and beyond. Some of the companies that should benefit in the space include the following.",

          "reportTitle": "Monday Tee Up: Tariffs, Jobs, Earnings Newly imposed U.S. tariffs (and the responses to them by the impacted countries) combine with the jobs report (due to hit the tape on Friday) and the ongoing flood or earnings reports to set the stage for a busy week. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%, the S&P 500 fell 1.0%, and the Nasdaq dropped 1.6%. So far in 2025, the DJIA is up 5%, the S&P is up 3%, and the Nasdaq is up 2%. Over the weekend, President Trump imposed tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. Canada announced their own retaliatory tariffs and, as of this writing, Mexico intends to respond. China said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The markets likely will experience some volatility as Wall Street assesses the impact of the tariffs. Items to consider are possible increased prices, supply-chain hiccups, changes to consumer spending patterns, and an uptick in overall inflation.  Meanwhile, the earnings flow continues. On Monday, Palantir, Tyson Foods, and Clorox are among the companies that will report; on Tuesday, Alphabet, Advanced Micro, Merck, Amgen, and PepsiCo; on Wednesday, Novo Nordisk, Qualcomm, Uber, and Disney; on Thursday, Amazon.com, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Honeywell, and ConocoPhillips; and on Friday, Fortive, Kimco, and Cboe Global. Some 178 (or 36%) of the S&P 500 companies have reported for last quarter. Earnings so far are showing 12% growth from the prior-year quarter. That compares to a 9% growth rate last quarter. The Financial sector has had the most companies report, and the growth rate so far is 13%, according to Refinitiv. Argus forecasts S&P 500 EPS growth in 2025 at 12%. For 2026, we forecast 11. On the economic calendar, the Nonfarm Payrolls report for January comes out on Friday. Though that report will get the most attention, the Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is Nonfarm Productivity. Chris expects growth to top 2%, while the consensus is 1.7%. Chris offers the following thoughts. 'While the jobs report provides a timely assessment of how the economy is doing, productivity, though volatile, is the best measure of a country's long-term prosperity and of workers ability to earn more than the inflation rate. Worker prosperity will dominate the American political landscape for the next four years. Productivity growth also will reflect the degree of success from the billions being spent on Artificial Intelligence.'  Last week, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. Mortgage rates dipped one basis point, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.95%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices fell a penny to an average of $3.10 per gallon for regular gas. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator is forecasting for 1Q and calls for expansion of 2.9%. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast is forecasting for January and is at 2.85%. The next Fed rate decision is on March 19, with odds at 17% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the next meeting is in early May.",

In the past three days, the S&P 500 (SPX) has gained almost 3%, while the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) have reclaimed over 3%. The SPX is up 3.6% from its intraday low last Friday, the Nasdaq has popped 4.5%, and the QQQ is up 4.2%. The SPX has retaken its 50-day average quickly, and the five-day/13-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossover is close to turning bullish. The five-/13-day EMA is already back to bullish on the Nasdaq and the QQQ. All three indices have retraced over 61.8% of their recent setbacks and are not far from making all-time highs.  Indicators we rarely talk about, and which are similar to Bollinger Bands, are price channels. For the daily chart, we use 20-day price channels. The upper channel is equal to the 20-day high, and the lower channel is equal to the 20-day low. The middle channel is the midpoint of the other two channels. There are many ways to interpret price channels. They can be used for support and resistance, overbought and oversold areas, the initiation of a strong uptrend with a break over the upper channel, and vice versa.  From October 2023, the SPX fell below its lower channel but rebounded quickly to the top channel. Price stayed between the mid- and upper channel until April 2024 -- when it fell back to the lower channel. SPX rebounded back to the top channel and then broke the midline in July. Since early August, prices have ripped back to the upper channel and found support from the mid- to lower channel. The index tested its bottom channel on Friday and popped once again.

No one is very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% current yield. But dividends are an important element of return. Dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.",

          "reportTitle": "At Argus, we believe ESG investing is smart investing. Companies committed to ESG values reflect positive traits from management, and those often translate into better business. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing has come a long way. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Association, global assets under management in ESG strategies were $30 trillion in 2021, up from $23 trillion in 2016. The discipline, originally Socially Responsible Investing, focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across industries that have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. At Argus, we track ESG progress at specific companies as part of our management analysis - one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point Fundamental System. In addition to reviewing and measuring the ESG proclamations from companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, JUST Capital, and leverage its analysis and insights. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records for not only delivering on the bottom line, but also for improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for employees. We also have a Theme Model Portfolio based in part on ESG criteria. To build the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio, we applied financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction, and growth at a reasonable price to our various lists. In addition, all stocks must be on the Argus BUY list.  The following are some of the stocks that currently are in the Argus U.S. ESG Model Portfolio.",

We're sure that decline and inability to hold $100,000 took some steam out of the market and surprised the many crypto cheerleaders.   We projected Bitcoin would reach $100,000 following a breakout above the top of its three-year cup-with-handle base at $70,000. Big round numbers in any market tend to be large psychological hurdles -- so it's not surprising to us that the big number has created some profit taking.  Believe it or not, one of the next forecast targets for Bitcoin is another double to $200,000. The cup-with-handle ranges from near $15,000 to $70,000. If there was a full 100% measured move using the depth of the bullish base, the target would be $125,000 -- with many other extensions of the $55,000 base coming in higher.   Bitcoin has traded in a bullish channel off its 2015 lows and December 2017 highs. If the crypto currency were to run up to the top of the channel (looking out three to nine months), we could come up with that $200,000 target.   FOMO (fear of missing out) and YOLO (you only live once) can be used to explain some of the action in the financial markets. If it's going up, just buy it. When it stops, jump on the next momentum bandwagon. End of day, enjoy it while it lasts! (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms.

          "reportTitle": "Summer Shakeout amid Positive EPS Season The stock market in mid- to late-July experienced its worst stretch of the year, including its worst week since 2022. The strong start to the month sent the S&P 500 and the other major indices to all-time highs. Even following the late-month selloff, stocks entered the final partial trading week of July barely changed for the month.  The stasis in the market is consistent with ongoing uncertainty. The nature of the presidential election changed dramatically over the past month. The Fed appears to be teeing up 50 basis points (bps) or possibly even 75 bps of rate cuts by the end of the year. However, no cuts appear likely until mid-September, leaving investors dangling. Consumers too are waiting for rate cuts, whether they know it or not, because a lower fed funds rate is the linchpin to getting the overall interest rate environment down from its multi-year peak. Amid the uncertainty, the second-quarter earnings season mostly has been a bright spot. While good past-quarter earnings are always important, investors hold their breaths regarding current-quarter outlooks. Companies have generally reaffirmed the moderately positive outlook for the full year, which is still trending toward high single-digit to low double-digit EPS growth for 2024.  Up and Down in July The S&P 500, which came into mid-year up 14.5% for 2024, piled on an additional 3.8% in the first half of July. The index was up 18.8% for the year at its all-time closing peak of 5,667 on 7/16/24. By 7/19/24, the S&P 500 had shed over 100 points. And by 7/25/24, the index had lost more than 260 points from its all-time high, to close at 5,399. Given the strong start to the month, followed by equally strong selling, the S&P 500 entered the final partial trading week of July up 14.4% for the year - barely budged from where it stood at mid-year. The Trump assassination attempt and the switch in Democratic presidential contenders occurred in the space of two weekends. However, rather than point to political upheaval, most investors attributed the July selling to a much-needed correction in extremely overbought names in the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors. While some wealth flowed out of all equities in the late-July period, much of the proceeds from tech stock redemptions flowed into other sectors.  With three trading days remaining in the month as of 7/26/24, Information Technology (IYW) was down 4% for the month of July; and Communication Services (XLC) was down just under 2%. Where did the money go? Lots flowed into the Financial sector (IYF), which was up 7% for the month. Upcoming cuts in the fed funds rate will pinch banks' net interest margins. However, the 2Q earnings season for the sector has been highly positive, featuring significant recovery in fee-based businesses such as investment banking. Those upcoming lower interest rates can also be expected to rekindle loan and mortgage growth, which have been an ongoing negative amid generally positive bank earnings results. Other winning sectors in July include Industrials (IYJ), up 4.5%; Utilities (IDU), up 3.3%; Healthcare, up 2.9%; Consumer Staples, up 2.5%; and Materials, up 2.4%. Most of these sectors rose with the market early in the month and then were able to hold onto their gains on generally positive second-quarter earnings results. As we prepared this report, the market on 7/29/24 was oscillating, rising in the morning on earnings optimism toward traditional growth leaders and then selling off by midday on fears those companies would disappoint. The market response to upcoming earnings and other major non-technology companies could determine not just the July outcome, but also the market's performance in August and into summer-end. Second-Quarter Earnings Season The above-cited July 29-through-August 2 period will be the biggest week in 2Q24 EPS season, with about one-third of S&P 500 components companies reporting results. We will be sure to weigh in on the biggest earnings week, which culminates with equally big economic news, the nonfarm payrolls for July on 8/2/24. In the interim, and based on 2Q24 EPS data through 7/26/24, the second-quarter earnings season has been a success so far. With just over 180 companies (36%) of S&P 500 component companies reporting, second-quarter 2024 earnings from continuing operations are up 9.1% on a share-weighted basis compared with 2Q23 EPS. According to Bloomberg, 2Q24 earnings are up 14.8% on a market-cap-weighted basis. This premium of market-cap-weighted to share-weighted EPS growth is consistent with recent quarters and is reflective of the earnings outperformance of the largest capitalization companies compared with small and mid-caps. According to the other earnings compiling agencies, FactSet reports 9.8% earnings growth for 2Q24 as of 7/26/24; and Refinitiv is reporting 12% earnings growth. Variation in performance measurements among FactSet, Refinitiv and Bloomberg reflect minor differences in calculating continuing operations earnings as well as different prior-year baselines. For the remainder of our 2Q earnings report card, we will mainly source Bloomberg data unless otherwise noted. An unusually high percentage of companies (31%) have reported negative earnings for 2Q24. The average EPS decline for the negative-earnings group, which is heavily weighted in Energy, Materials, and Real Estate, is 16%. For the 69% of companies reporting positive EPS, average earnings growth is a robust 22%. A key reason investors are optimistic about second-half 2024 earnings growth is that the negative drag from Energy, Materials, and Real Estate is expected to diminish in 3Q24 and particularly in 4Q24. About 79% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises in 2Q24, compared with (again) a high 14% of companies reporting negative surprises. According to FactSet, 78% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises. These percentage are above the 10-year average of 74%. For these companies, the median beat against consensus estimates is 5.2% (FactSet has it at 4.4%). For the first time in several quarters, the median beat against expectations is below the 10-year average of 6.8%. At the sector level, the strongest earnings growth is coming from Financial, Information Technology, and Utilities - all up in the 16%-17% range year over year. Communication Services 2Q24 earnings are up 15%. Other sectors reporting positive EPS growth include Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, and Industrials, in descending order; all are up in the 2%-4% range. As noted, Energy, Materials, and Real Estate are all down; Materials is off in high single-digits, while Energy and Real Estate earnings are down 20%-21% from a year earlier.  From a statistical standpoint, 36% would be considered a fairly reliable and predictive sample size. Timing of the remainder of 2Q24 earnings season, however, may introduce some variability. Over 61% of Financial companies have already reported, in what has been a better-than-anticipated season for the sector. Only 23% of Energy companies have reported; given similar sensitivity off all component companies to key commodities (oil and natural gas), the contribution from this sector will likely continue to pull down overall results. The swing sector is likely to be Information Technology. Fewer than 30% of tech companies have reported. Further, 2Q earnings from the heavy hitters (Apple, Microsoft, etc.) are not reflected in the data discussed above. Earnings from the big Healthcare, Industrial, and Consumer Discretionary (AMZN) companies could also play an outsized role. For 2Q24, Argus continues to model high-single-digit continuing-operations EPS growth for S&P 500 component companies. We see a higher likelihood that our forecast misses on the upside than on the downside. In other words, once all the component companies are tallied, we are more likely to see low-double-digit EPS growth for 2Q24 than we are to see mid-single-digit EPS growth.   Conclusion Investors will veer away from earnings analysis for a few hours on the morning of 8/2/24 to assess the state of the labor economy. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, forecasts 185,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs for July, approximately in line with the 188,000 consensus forecast. The bigger focus will be on the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in June. If July unemployment hits 4.2%, that would trigger the Sahm indicator. When unemployment rises 50 bps within a cycle, the Sahm rule posits, recession follows or has already begun. In this scenario, deteriorating labor markets become 'a self-reinforcing feedback loop,' according to former New York Fed president William Dudley.  Secular and demographic factors may argue for structurally lower unemployment rates over the long term. This includes ongoing retirements from within the huge Baby Boomer cohort, and a smaller pool of workers from the generational cohorts that follow available to fill vacant boomer positions. Triggering the Sahm rule, nonetheless, would be a warning sign and presumably a wake-up call for the Fed to focus on the fight in front of it (preventing recession) and not the nearly won war against inflation.",

BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced in January 2020 that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

Dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks. High-yield stocks typically have dividends that pay out in the 5%-8% range. Though the income appears attractive, the share prices of high-yield stocks may be at risk.  Dividend-growth stocks typically have lower yields, often in the 1.0%-2.5% range. But the lower-yielding dividends are not likely to be a huge component of cash flow, leaving management teams with other value-additive options for deploying cash. Further, while the yields are not as high, management teams may be more likely to boost the payouts over time, as earnings grow.",

But it doesn't suggest it is time to run for the exits. Vickers' broadest sentiment reading, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio, is currently 2.45 and still within the neutral territory between 2.00 and 2.50. Since early October, the ratio has floated in the neutral zone and, like now, has flirted several time with a break into bearish territory above 2.50. But so far, it has not. On an exchange basis, the NYSE eight-week remains neutral at 2.37, while the Nasdaq eight-week has pushed into bearish territory with a reading of 2.61. But considering the Nasdaq's significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, we aren't shocked that insiders on the exchange are taking some money off the table.",

Alphabet lost a steep 10% in one day last week after investors expressed their disappointment over growth in its cloud business. That same day, Microsoft surged after reporting better-than-expected growth in its Azure OpenAI cloud service. The race is on, and some will win and some will lose along the way. But the potential pie is big. In the internet era, in which digital commerce complements or has supplanted physical commerce, the information technology needs of all enterprises have grown. The traditional on-premises approach has been rendered inefficient, given that a user's IT needs may fluctuate at any time. Into this void, the Cloud has arrived. In Cloud services models, an enterprise's IT needs can be matched and scaled in real time. Through the Cloud, enterprises consume only as much computing, storage, and networking bandwidth as they need. For a major event, this allows massive scaling of IT resources beyond the restraints of on-premises implementation. For periods in which operations are steady, the Cloud services model allows for a needs-only application. The leading providers of Cloud services tend to be large Technology and Communication Services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their Cloud businesses. Growth has been impressive for this group. Collectively, participants in the Cloud eco-system grew revenue at a 19% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2022. Still, the line isn't straight up.  While Cloud services grew at a 23% growth rate from 2020 to 2021, the average growth rate slowed to 15.3% for 2022.  This slowdown in revenue growth reflected impediments to normal business activity from the supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising interest rates. Even so, demand for Cloud services has held up relatively well, given that Cloud transition is a long-tailed process and that Cloud transformation has become an imperative. Here is a list of U.S.-based companies followed by Argus and that we think are in position to take advantage of this secular trend.",

          "reportTitle": "The growth prospects for the artificial intelligence (AI) universe are impressive, yet hard to determine. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba). Finally, Niche Tech has significant AI activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation and connectivity solutions for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas. Here are featured companies followed by Argus in those three categories.",

          "reportTitle": "Argus Research believes that ESG investing is a smart option to consider. Companies committed to ESG values typically reflect positive traits from management which often translate into better business. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing has come a long way and continues to grow. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Association, global assets under management in ESG strategies were $40 trillion in 2020, up from $23 trillion in 2016 and on track for $50 trillion by 2025. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. But performance of these initial strategies lagged. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across industries that have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. At Argus Research, we track ESG progress at specific companies as part of our Management analysis -- one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point System for fundamental research. In addition to reviewing and measuring the ESG proclamations from companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, JUST Capital, and leverage its analysis and insights. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled focused lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have a \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records of delivering on the bottom line, and also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We also have a theme model portfolio based in part on ESG criteria. To build the Argus U.S. ESG Theme Model Portfolio, we apply financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction, and growth at a reasonable price to our various lists. In addition, all stocks must be on the Argus BUY list. For more on JUST Capital's criteria, please visit the JUST Capital website, www.justcapital.com. For more information on the Argus companies, please see our Analyst Reports at www.argusresearch.com. Here are some of the stocks that are currently in the Argus U.S. ESG Theme Model Portfolio.",

Bank of America shares rose 4% after the company reported strong 2Q earnings, helped by growth in net interest income. Morgan Stanley shares also rose, despite lower second-quarter earnings, after management projected generally stronger results in the second half of the year and in 2024. Retail sales were weaker than expected. The Commerce Department said that U.S. retail sales rose 0.2% in June, down from a revised 0.5% in May and below the Reuters consensus forecast of 0.5% growth. The Dow rose 0.8%, the S&P rose 0.2%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.2%. Crude oil traded near $75 per barrel, while gold jumped $28 to $1984 per ounce.",

No one is very focused on the broad market index's 1.6% current yield. But dividends are an important element of return. Dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. In 2018, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices declined as the Fed hiked rates. The pattern was repeated in 2022. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.",

BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced in January 2020 that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",
