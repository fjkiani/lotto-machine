# News Exploit Strategy - Alpha Intelligence 🔥

## Executive Summary

**Can we make money from news divergences?** YES - but with conditions.

The edge is in **DIVERGENCES** - when institutional flow (dark pools) contradicts the price action or news sentiment.

---

## The Strategy 🎯

### BUY Signal (Panic Buy)
```
Headlines: "Market crashes", "Panic selling", "Risk-off"
Price: DOWN > 0.5%
Dark Pool: > 45% (institutions accumulating)
→ BUY the dip - institutions buying what retail is selling
```

### SELL Signal (Rally Sell)
```
Headlines: "Market rallies", "Bullish momentum", "Risk-on"
Price: UP > 0.5%
Dark Pool: < 25% (institutions distributing)
→ SELL the rip - institutions selling what retail is buying
```

### NO Signal (Hold)
```
- DP 25-45% = Neutral institutional activity
- DP confirms price direction = No divergence edge
- Low volatility days = No signal opportunity
```

## What's Working ✅

1. **ChartExchange API** - Dark pool data is flowing
2. **Divergence Detection Logic** - Rules are implemented
3. **Price History** - yfinance working for SPY/QQQ
4. **Crypto Correlation** - BTC/ETH vs SPY working

## What's Missing ⏳

1. **Perplexity API** - Need for real-time news sentiment
   - This will categorize headlines as BULLISH/BEARISH
   - Then compare with DP flow for divergence
   
2. **Integration** - Need to wire into lotto machine
   - Add divergence score to signal generator
   - Boost confidence when divergence detected
   
3. **Volatile Markets** - Need market volatility
   - Current period is calm (no edge)
   - Strategy activates during volatile days

## How to Use This Strategy 📋

### During RTH (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET):

1. **Check Morning News**
   - What are headlines saying?
   - BULLISH ("rally", "surge", "risk-on")
   - BEARISH ("crash", "selloff", "risk-off")

2. **Check Dark Pool Activity**
   - Run: `python3 test_divergence_edge.py`
   - DP > 45% = Institutions accumulating
   - DP < 25% = Institutions distributing

3. **Look for Divergence**
   - News BEARISH + DP > 45% = **BUY SIGNAL**
   - News BULLISH + DP < 25% = **SELL SIGNAL**
   - No divergence = **NO TRADE**

4. **Execute Trade**
   - Entry: On divergence detection
   - Stop: 2% from entry
   - Target: 2% from entry
   - Position: 2% of capital

## Next Steps 🚀

### Immediate (Today):
1. ✅ Test divergence detection logic - DONE
2. ✅ Verify DP data working - DONE
3. ⏳ Set up Perplexity API key for news sentiment

### This Week:
4. ⏳ Integrate divergence into signal generator
5. ⏳ Run during RTH and log divergence signals
6. ⏳ Paper trade any divergence signals

### Next Week:
7. ⏳ Analyze paper trade results
8. ⏳ If win rate > 55%, deploy with small capital

## Risk Management ⚠️

- **Position Size**: 2% per trade max
- **Daily Drawdown**: 5% max
- **Stop Loss**: Always set before entry
- **No FOMO**: Only trade on clear divergences
- **No Overtrading**: Divergences are RARE - that's what makes them valuable

---

## Expected Performance 📈

Based on the strategy logic:
- **Win Rate Target**: 55-60%
- **Risk/Reward**: 1:1 minimum
- **Trades per Week**: 1-3 (divergences are rare)
- **Monthly Return Target**: 2-4%

> The edge is small but consistent. We're not trying to hit home runs.
> We're exploiting information asymmetry when institutions do opposite of news.
