## 🔥 THE EDGE

### Why This Works

1. **Data-Driven Predictions**
   - Not just if/then rules
   - Actual historical market reactions
   - Statistical correlations

2. **Psychology Layer**
   - Trump wrote his playbook
   - We encoded it
   - Detect bluffs, manufactured deadlines, victory claims

3. **Combined Confidence**
   - Data says X, Playbook says Y
   - If they align → HIGH confidence
   - If Playbook detects bluff → FADE the data-driven prediction

4. **Continuous Learning**
   - Every new statement gets collected
   - Market reactions get linked
   - Patterns get updated
   - System gets smarter over time

## 💰 TRADING STRATEGIES

### When Trump Says "Tariff"
```
DATA: BEARISH (-0.74% expected)
PLAYBOOK: Check for "Calculated Bluff" pattern
IF bluff detected:
  → FADE: Buy the dip near deadline
  → Target: Relief rally
  → Size: Small (bluffs can become real)
```

### When Trump Says "Deal"
```
DATA: BULLISH (+0.82% expected)
PLAYBOOK: Check for "Symbolic Victory" pattern
IF symbolic victory:
  → BUY rumor, SELL announcement
  → Near elections: More likely to be "wins"
```

### When Trump Attacks Companies
```
PLAYBOOK: "Attack the Weakness" pattern
→ SHORT attacked company short-term
→ LONG competitors
→ Size: Small (attacks can fizzle)
```
