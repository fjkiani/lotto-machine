🔥 EXPLOITATION MODULES - ALPHA'S EDGE
======================================

These modules exploit ChartExchange Tier 3 API data that we're NOT using elsewhere.
Each module is designed to find specific edge cases and generate MONEY-MAKING signals.

Modules:
- squeeze_detector: Detects short squeeze setups using SI%, borrow fees, FTDs
- (future) gamma_tracker: Tracks dealer gamma exposure and positioning
- (future) opportunity_scanner: Scans for high institutional flow opportunities
- (future) ftd_analyzer: Analyzes failure-to-deliver patterns
- (future) reddit_contrarian: Contrarian signals from Reddit sentiment
